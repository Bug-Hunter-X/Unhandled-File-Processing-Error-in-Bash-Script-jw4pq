# Unhandled File Processing Error in Bash Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with file operations.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file but fails silently if the file does not exist or is inaccessible. The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug Description

The original script lacks checks for file existence and accessibility. If `my_file.txt` is missing, the `cat` command will fail without producing an error message, leaving the user unaware of the problem.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `-f` option with `test` or `[[ ]]` to check for file existence and a proper exit code.
